  <ul>
    <li><b>Water Conservation:</b> Implemented various measures to recharge groundwater and manage water resources effectively.</li>
    <li><b>Community Involvement:</b>  The "four bandis" (bans on tree felling, free grazing, family planning, and liquor) were enacted with the support of the villagers.</li>
  </ul>
